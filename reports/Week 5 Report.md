### Chris
- I got the text generator to work with strings and am able to print them to console from the frontend.
    - The way that I was previously implementing it was based on an implementation I did using React classes, which does not work on this project since we are using hooks instead.
    - Currently working on displaying the text sample on the page. Since we can't do top-level awaits for async functions, I'm experimenting with the React useEffect hook for this.
- Configured GitHub Actions for automatic execution of JavaScript tests using MochaJS.

## 3. Plans / Goals
