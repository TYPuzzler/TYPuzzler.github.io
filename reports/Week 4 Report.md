## 2. What We Did  
- Finalized architecture and design of our project
- Finished writeup for architecture and design
## 3. Meeting Agenda
- Investigate adding tests to our project
# Contributions  
## 1. Last Week's Plans / Goals
### Margaret  
- Research more about APIs and frameworks for capturing user input and information, connecting to backend systems.
- Implement more ideas for trying to create a basic frontend.
### Chris  
- Research more APIs for text sample generation since the one currently in use often provides samples with punctuation errors.
    - After discussing this part of the plan with the group, we decided to stick with the API currently being used to generate text samples and to postpone the search of other APIs until later.
- Add parameters to the random text generator to allow for different types of typing samples.
- Start implementing accuracy checking functionality
### Bowen  
- 
### Eric  
- Work on refining the navigation UI
- Start on typing UI
## 2. What We Did  
### Margaret
- Reviewed more technologies and methods to use for the frontend.
### Eric  
- Wasn't able to work on the project much this week
- Added more pages to navigate for the entire frontend app
### Bowen
- 
### Chris
- I was able to read some documentation as well as the source code from related projects that I completed for previous courses to help me with implementing the text generation and accuracy checking functionality.
- I worked a little more on the random text generator in my working directory.
    - Currently determining whether I should use the `fetch` API or `XMLHttpRequest` to communicate with the API.
- I have not added the ability to use parameters on the text generator yet since it's not completely necessary at the moment.
    - Should not be difficult to add if we do decide on it since it only requires modification of the request parameters
- Did not start implementing the accuracy checking functionality.
## 3. Plans / Goals  
### Margaret
- Catch up on last week's goals.
- Implement frontend elements to try to connect to the backend elements
### Bowen
- 
### Chris
- Complete a working version of text generation and accuracy checking functionality.
- Discuss with team to determine whether or not the text generator should be parameterized to allow for different text lengths.
### Eric  
- Health permitting, work on catching up from last week's goals
- Ideally have UI that is ready to interact with the puzzle backend
