# TYPuzzler

TYPuzzler is a typing practice application (web app) developed by Chris Choi, Margaret Li, Bowen Tian and Eric Yoon. Practice typing while collecting pieces to complete a puzzle. We hope this makes learning to type a fun time!

Our product is an app to practice typing. It will allow users to complete typing exercises, and earn pieces of a puzzle as they go. Users will be able to view and download the whole picture when they finish a puzzle. It will be a browser app accessible through a public URL.

Our goals are to:

* Allow user to practice typing exercises of text snippets in real time

* Track and report userâ€™s typing accuracy and speed at the end of a typing exercise

* During a typing exercise, only advance if the user enters the right current character

* Reward the user with a puzzle piece (chosen by user from three hidden pieces) when an exercise is finished

* Show the completed puzzle when all pieces have been obtained, then allow the user to download the full image

* Provide multiple puzzles for the user to solve
