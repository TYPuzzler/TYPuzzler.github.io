# TYPuzzler

TYPuzzler is a typing practice application developed by Chris Choi, Margaret Li, Bowen Tian and Eric Yoon. Practice typing while collecting pieces to solve a puzzle. We hope this makes learning to type enjoyable and exciting!

## Product Description
Our product is a web browser app to practice typing. It will allow users to complete typing exercises, and earn pieces of a puzzle as they go. Users will be able to view and download the whole picture when they finish a puzzle. It is publicly accessible at https://typuzzler.github.io/.

See [userManual.md](/userManual.md) for instructions on how to use TYPuzzler. If you would like to contribute to the project, please read the instructions in [developerGuide.md](/developerGuide.md).
